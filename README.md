## Overview
The integration of **advanced myoelectric prosthetics** into the human body is a frontier in neuroscience and bioengineering.  
This repository contains a **literature review** exploring how the brain adapts to prosthetic limbs through **neuroplasticity** and **cortical remapping**, and how **AI technologies**â€”such as **brain-computer interfaces (BCIs)** and **adaptive machine learning**â€”support this adaptation.

## ðŸ”¬ Scientific Concepts

### 1. Neuroprosthetic
A **neuroprosthetic** is a device, such as a cochlear implant or a deep brain stimulator, that replaces or modulates lost or impaired neural functions by either providing electrical stimulation to neural tissue or by picking up signals from the brain to control external devices. This interdisciplinary field of engineering and neuroscience aims to restore motor, sensory, and cognitive functions for individuals affected by neurological conditions or injuries, bridging the gap between the nervous system and external technology.

</p>



### 2. Neuroplasticity
**Neuroplasticity** is the brain's remarkable ability to change, adapt, and reorganize itself throughout life by forming new neural connections, strengthening existing ones, and even altering its structural and functional organization. This lifelong process allows the brain to learn new skills, form memories, recover from injuries, and adapt to new environments and experiences. While it enables beneficial changes like recovery from injury, it can also lead to maladaptive changes, such as the entrenchment of unhealthy habits or the development of chronic pain.

</p>

### 3. Brain-Computer Interface (BCI)
A **BCI**  is a system that establishes a direct communication pathway between the brain and an external device, such as a computer or robotic limb, bypassing the traditional neuromuscular pathways. By measuring and analyzing brain signals, BCIs can translate a person's thoughts and intentions into actionable commands, enabling interaction with the environment and restoration of lost functions for individuals with severe motor or sensory impairments, such as those with paralysis or spinal cord injuries.

## Problem Statement
Despite advances in prosthetics, several challenges remain:

- **Neural adaptation variability:** Not all users adapt to prosthetics at the same rate.  
- **Limited AI personalization:** Prosthetic systems are often not tailored to individual neural patterns.  
- **Ethical concerns:** Issues of identity, accessibility, and data privacy are not fully addressed.  
- **Knowledge gaps:** Long-term effects of brain-prosthetic integration are still understudied.

This research seeks to **analyze these challenges** and propose avenues for AI-driven solutions.

## Objectives
1. Examine how **neuroplasticity and cortical remapping** enable prosthetic integration.  
2. Evaluate the role of **AI and machine learning** in enhancing motor control and sensory feedback.  
3. Identify **ethical, social, and accessibility implications** of advanced neuroprosthetics.  
4. Highlight **research gaps** and suggest directions for future studies.

## Key Insights
- **Neuroplasticity enables adaptation:** Brain regions reorganize to incorporate prosthetic control.  
- **BCIs and machine learning enhance performance:** AI interprets neural signals to provide smoother, intuitive prosthetic movement.  
- **VR and haptic feedback improve training:** Simulated tasks accelerate cortical remapping.  
- **Ethical and social implications:** Prosthetic use raises questions about identity, autonomy, and inclusivity.

## Cortical Remapping in Neuroprosthetics

**Cortical remapping** is the process by which the brain reorganizes its neural pathways after limb loss.  
This allows users to regain motor control over prosthetic limbs by reallocating cortical areas that previously controlled the missing limb.
